# Building Automation Systems Overview

## Introduction to Building Automation

Building Automation Systems (BAS) are centralized, interlinked networks of hardware and software that monitor and control the environment in commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities. BAS core functionality keeps building climate within a specified range, provides lighting based on an occupancy schedule, monitors system performance and device failures, and emails notifications to building engineering staff.

## Key Components of Building Automation Systems

### 1. Controllers

- **Building Controllers (BC)**
  - Primary controllers that manage major building systems
  - Handle scheduling, trending, and alarm management
  - Connect to field controllers and IT networks
