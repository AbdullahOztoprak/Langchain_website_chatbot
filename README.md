# Industrial Automation AI Assistant 🚀🤖

> This project was developed as a showcase for an industrial automation AI internship application. It demonstrates skills in software design, implementation, debugging, unit/module testing, test automation, and release tasks for industrial automation projects. The solution leverages state-of-the-art AI models (LLMs), LangChain, and modern web technologies (Streamlit, FastAPI) to create a professional chatbot focused on industrial/building automation topics.
>
> **Key responsibilities and qualifications addressed in this project:**
> - Applied AI for industrial/building automation
> - LLM-based solution development (LangChain, OpenAI)
> - Frontend/backend development (Streamlit, FastAPI)
> - Test automation and modular architecture
> - Research and prototyping with real industrial documentation
> - Passion for new technologies and tools

## 🧪 Testing & Test Automation

Unit and module tests are provided to ensure code reliability and maintainability. You can run all tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

- All core logic (LLM helpers, utility functions) are covered by tests.
- You can add more tests in the `tests/` directory for new features.
- Test automation is recommended for professional development and CI/CD.
